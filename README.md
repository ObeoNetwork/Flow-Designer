Flow-Designer
=============

This is the Flow Designer sample for Obeo Designer.

![Overview](./overview.png "Overview")


To install it, the easiest way is to download [Obeo Designer Community Edition 11.5.0](https://www.obeodesigner.com/en/download) which provides a ready-to-use bundle with Sirius 6.5.1. Just check out this source code, and use a runtime workspace to try the sample with these two projects:
* org.obeonetwork.sample.robot
* fr.obeo.dsl.designer.sample.flow.design

Last change: 
* Update SVGs and icons
* Upgrade to Sirius 6.5.1 (and OD 11.5.0)
* Simplify the VSM for the demo purpose
* Improve the L&F of the sample.

The very next steps for this project are:
* CDO-ification of the metamodel
* Propose a scenario of improvement with Power Supply
