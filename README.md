To install it, the easiest way is to download [Obeo Designer Community Edition 11.8.0](https://www.obeodesigner.com/en/download) which provides a ready-to-use bundle with Sirius 7.1.0. Just check out this source code, and use a runtime workspace to try the sample with these two projects:

Last change: 
* Update SVGs and icons
* Upgrade to Sirius 6.5.1 (and OD 11.5.0)

* Improve the L&F of the sample.
